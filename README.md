# pico-weather
Weather station for Raspberry Pi Pico



Software for the Raspberry Pi Pico, makes use of:
I) BME280 sensor
II) Oled dispay 128x64 96 "

In the "lib" folder there is a modified version of the "ssd1306" library 
that allows you to read the single values in float format.

# Installation
You need the above components.
Clone the repository and copy it as is to your RPi Pico and launch the "main.py" file.

# Future updates
I'll upload a circuit diagram.
I'll document the code.
Maybe I'll add new features
